1 - 5V Power Supply
2 - Data 1
3 - Data 0
4 - Request/Select 1/TR
5 - Select/Select 0/TH
6 - Acknowledge/TL
7 - Data 3
8 - Data 2
9 - Ground

Electrical:
All signal lines are pulled up to 5V with 10K ohm resistors inside the console.

Protocol:
Digital 6-button Saturn pads use the Select lines to select which buttons' states are reflected by Data 0 through Data 3.

The 3D Control Pad has a digital and analog mode, both of which use a synchronous 4-bit parallel interface. Signal lines idle high.
Console: Drives Select low to activate controller, drives Request low to request first nibble
Controller: Drives Data 0-3, then drives Acknowledge low to signal that data is valid
Console: Reads Data 0-3, then drives Request high to request second nibble
Controller: Drives Data 0-3, then drives Acknowledge high to signal that data is valid
...Process repeats until console drives Select high to deactivate the controller.

The first nibble the 3D Control Pad sends is the controller mode, 0b0000 for digital, 0b0001 for analog.
The second nibble is the data length. 3D Control Pad in digital mode reads 0b0100 (2 bytes), analog reads 0b0110 (6 bytes)
Digital data:
Nibble 1: Right (0x8), Left (0x4), Down (0x2), Up (0x1)
Nibble 2: Start (0x8), A (0x4), C (0x2), B (0x1)
Nibble 3: R (0x8), X (0x4), Y (0x2), Z (0x1)
Nibble 4: L (0x8), 1, 1, 1
